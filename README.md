# Concept

* For the time being, simplifying things, we have an array of integers which need to tuned.
* Use simple cross-over and mutation, with favoritism.
* Using Roulette's method of selection

# [TODO]

* Implement the genetic algorithm for integral inputs.
* Introduce n-match algorithm and replace the Roulette method.
* Implement the same for floating point numbers.
* Use in combination with python-crush/crush/optimize.py

# Specific TODO

* Implement `remove_similar_chromo()`
* Implement `favoritism()`
* Implement `assign_fitness()` [This is specific to Ceph]
